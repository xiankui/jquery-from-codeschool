In order to get these working, you'll need to install the "serve gem" (or really anything that creates a server, but this one is the easiest).

```
$ gem install serve
$ serve
Thin 1.5.0 available at http://0.0.0.0:4000
>> Thin web server (v1.5.0 codename Knife)
>> Maximum connections set to 1024
>> Listening on 0.0.0.0:4000, CTRL+C to stop
```

Then you can head go to http://0.0.0.0:4000/level1/slide1-1.html
